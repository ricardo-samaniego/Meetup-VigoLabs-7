# Meetup VigoLabs 7: Introduction to OpenCV
The code contained on this repository was created to illustrate the 7th VigoLabs' Meetup: a small talk about OpenCV celebrated in Vigo (Spain).

The presentation used in the talk is included, but only in spanish.

Below I identify clearly the third party code fragments reproduced here with permission. You can use the rest of the code for any purpose you want to.

Included demos are:
	
## Basic example
A minimal OpenCV 3.0 C++ program demonstrating how to open a camera, acquire images and show them in a window.

## Ball tracking
Colored balls tracking using OpenCV and Python. The code is based on Adrian Rosebrock's code for the article [Ball Tracking with OpenCV](URL http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/). Many thanks to the crew of PyImageSearch for allowing me to use, modify and publish it.

## Optical flow
Both dense and sparse optical flow Python demos. These demos are included with the standard OpenCV 3.2.0 documentation and examples. Hence, they are licensed under BSD.

## Background substraction
Simple Python background substraction code based on the MOG (Mixture Of Gaussians) method.

## Face detection test
Simple OpenCV 2 C code demonstrating face detection based on Haar Classifiers.

## Laser line test
OpenCV 2 C code for 3D measurements using [structured light](URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured-light_3D_scanner). You will need a laser line projector for running this demo.
