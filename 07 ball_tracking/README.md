## Ball tracking
Colored balls tracking using OpenCV and Python. The code is based on Adrian Rosebrock's code for the article [Ball Tracking with OpenCV](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/). Many thanks to the crew of PyImageSearch for allowing me to use, modify and publish it.
